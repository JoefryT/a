        <p>This is a amazing achievement that one of our many great students have achieved. The other schools were very challenging opponents
          and we would like to commend them of their great effort. The inter school debate competition consists of the finest schools. Only
          schools of certain standards can join and our school qualified. One of our bright minded students volunteered for this competition
          and came out victorious and successful.

          is crazy because of the other schools that dedicate themselves to science. Our school strives to achieve greatness in all subjects
          but these students are exceeding in science. Our school is performing absolutely great in our inter school competitions and really 
          appreciate our students constant hard work.

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to
          consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
          with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed description of their ingredients help both students and
          parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff memeber who accesses the canteen could be
          provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
          and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can 
          eliminate all the fuss of money handling. Making it safe and less complicated for staff and students alike. 
          Here again, diversity is the key.

        <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Accuracy
          Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
          management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data 
          entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
          <br>
          2. Economics
          Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It
          saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, tardiness, time abuse  
          and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Assium Group found that large organazations
          save up to $1 600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems. 
          <br>
          3.Productivity/Efficiency Montoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming,laborious and expensive affair.
          It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorise leave and overtime, and create payroll manually.
          Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to 
          automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in potmizing the use of resources
          which lead to increased productivity and imporves profits. And many more like Visibility/Insights/Configuration, Real-time tracking, Security and Compliance.
